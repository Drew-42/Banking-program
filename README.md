# Banking-program
A simple interactive banking application, with multiple functionalities (show balance, deposit, withdraw, exit).
This is the first time I used a main() function, summoned only when the file is run as a script (if __name__ == '__main__'). I learned this is an important and recommended practice when writing Python code, to ensure that the code doesn't run by accident if the file is imported as a module.
The point of this program is to further practice...
